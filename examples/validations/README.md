Forms often have validation logic on the front-end, to show immediate feedback to the user about if what they're entering is valid or not.

T-Shirt Forms is very modular, and by default comes without any validation code tied into it.

However, it also allows you to very easily hook in any validation library you want! It also comes with out-of-the-box support for [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup).
