Often you don't want to use a plain text input, you want to use your own custom text input.

Or, you want some default values for particular inputs.

ReFormJS lets you do this by specifying `component` or `defaultValue` in the form schema. It also allows calling `setSchemaDefaults`, a global call that will change how _any_ ReFormJS form works.
