ReFormJS lets override its rendering methods, such as `renderButtons`, for a particular form.

But often, you might have a default way of rendering these items, that you want to be the default for all forms.

ReFormJS lets you do this by calling `setOptionDefaults`, a global call that will change how _any_ ReFormJS form works.
